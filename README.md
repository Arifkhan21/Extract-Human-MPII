# Extract-Human-MPII
- This repository is part of a subtask for my Human Pose Detection Project.
- In this repository i used YOLO v3 model to detect objects in images and only took human class for further work.
- The area of bounding box is cropeed and saved in other directory.
- Only one person per picture for whom the annopoints in MPII dataset is given is cropped.
- Annopoints are accordingly scaled and saved as a csv file.
